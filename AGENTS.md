- Shared navigation and layout live in src/components/site-shell.tsx so every public page stays visually consistent.
- Static program, fleet, location, and testimonial content lives in src/lib/site-data.ts to keep route pages concise and facts consistent.
- Aircraft imagery must originate from Lakes Area Aviation's official site and preserve each real airplane's registration, paint, and physical details.

- All 24 public pages are prerendered via the explicit `pages` list in vite.config.ts; add new static routes there (router uses trailingSlash "preserve" so prerender requests do not redirect-loop).
- Bundled photos are WebP (heroes max 1920px, fleet cards max 1280px) to keep pages light.
- The global accent theme is read from the public site_settings row; only a database-verified admin role may change it.
- Scroll-journey stages may use optimized CDN video with a real-photo poster; video plays only while its stage is active to protect mobile performance.
- Both homepage journeys use the shared pure journey-pacing mapping for reading windows, transitions, active steps, and click destinations; measure scrolling against the sticky viewport so imagery and copy stay synchronized on mobile.
- Journey one-page-per-swipe uses native mandatory scroll-snap stops (scroll-snap-stop: always), enabled on <html> only while a journey is pinned so visitors scroll freely into and out of it; touch stays fully native. The only wheel handling steps one stop per fresh wheel gesture with a fixed, never-extending lock, because an extending lock previously froze the page. Programmatic jumps use glideTo, which suspends snapping.
- Scroll management is explicit in src/router.tsx (instant top-of-page reset on real navigations via onBeforeRouteMount, so the old page never glides or flashes); never re-enable TanStack's built-in scrollRestoration — its reset can fire from a late hydration settle and yank a scrolling visitor to the top.

- Airport traffic patterns are drawn in each USGS aerial's pixel space from FAA airport data kept in site-data (elevation, pattern altitude, runway, direction), so altitudes and pattern sides stay factual; geometry is pure and tested in traffic-pattern.ts.
